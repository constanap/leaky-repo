# FAQ
## What is this?
This is a repo full of mistakes. I will include several of the secrets I've seen commonly leaking from real projects. It will be useful for testing scanning tools such as [github-dorks](https://github.com/techgaun/github-dorks) and [truffleHog](https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog).

## Where did you get these?
It's worth noting that none of the secrets here are real. They are all things I've seen before, but I've randomized or redacted all of the actual data. The vast majority of secrets will likely be taken from patterns created for github-dorks, which are primarily taken from config files for popular services. I've also worked on several scanning tools in the past. Most notably, github-dorks, [PasteHunter](https://github.com/kevthehermit/PasteHunter), [github-dorks](https://github.com/techgaun/github-dorks), as well as [GHScraper](https://github.com/Plazmaz/GHScraper), and several other non-public or unreleased scanners. Essentially, I've seen a **lot** of whoopsies on git, which will also be included.

## Why did you make this repo?
This repo was made to serve as a benchmark for secrets scanners. Repo scanning tools have varying levels of coverage, and so far the go-to option has been "slam a bunch together". This repo is also partially to test my theory that this technique still isn't really sufficient. Regardless, you can't _just_ scan for high entropy, and you can't _just_ scan for patterns, you need to do both!

## How can I avoid uploading these secrets?
I've written a blog post on [Why We Fail at Keeping Git Secrets](https://dylankatz.com/Why-We-Fail-At-Keeping-Git-Secrets/?utm_source=leaky_repo). If you truly want to keep your secrets safe, seperate them from your repo. If that's a config file, that's fine. If it's a secrets management/storage system, that's even better. As long as you can stop git from adding that information by default, you're unlikely to hit any problems.

It's also worth noting that many of the original patterns used to find the filenames and examples of several secrets came from github-dorks, which is under tha [Apache 2.0 License](https://github.com/techgaun/github-dorks/blob/master/LICENSE). Also, for the sake of full disclosure, I am a maintainer on that project.
